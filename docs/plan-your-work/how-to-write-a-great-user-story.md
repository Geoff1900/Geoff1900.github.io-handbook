>A *User story* is short description of what’s needed, told from a user’s perspective. Scrum teams write User Stories to capture requirements. 

To write a great user story:-

- Refine each story so everyone understands what must be done 
- Account for hidden work to help you manage technical debt 
- Add acceptance criteria to make clear when a story is complete 
- Share common criteria in a Definition of Done and publish it to your Kanban board
